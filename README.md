- 👋 Hi, I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Purdue University, 
where I work on development of high-dimensional distributed statistical learning
algorithms and their applications in machine learning. 
Previously, I received my PhD in Engineering from Purdue University working with Gesualdo Scutari. 
I also hold BSc (2013) and MS (2015) degrees in Electrical Engineering. See my CV page for my most recent curriculum vitae.
- 👀 I am broadly interested in Applied Machine Learning and Optimization and passionate about learning cutting-edge ML solutions. 
I have previously developed large-scale and distributed frameworks for big-data machine learning problems with strong theoretical guarantees.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mid-level ML projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: adaneshm@purdue.edu
